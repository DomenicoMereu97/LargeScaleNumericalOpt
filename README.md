# Constrained Optimization Problem 
This report outlines the results of optimizing a Large-Scale problem in box contraints. The method used to obtain the results is the projected gradient method with backtrack as a line search strategy, using Exact Derivatives and Finite Differences.

Different techniques were explored. One of them was testing the effect of different contraction factors œÅ on the descent rates in the backtracking algorithm. 

Another technique involved replacing the exact gradient with approximations using finite differences. A comparison was made between the central difference method and the forward difference method, and the results showed that the former performs better in terms of accuracy and avoiding premature stops.
